# Polymorphism

the ability of an object or function to take many forms.

depending on context or situation.

Java has:
* runtime polymorphism
  based on inheritance eg: ArrayList, NonNegArrayList(manually implemented).

  achieved by overriding functionality.

* compile time polymorphism
  eg: overloading functions.


interface is a set of method signatures to be implemented (specification) can only implement static methods.

instance methods can only be specifications which have to be implemented by concrete class.

all methods are public and abstract, all fields are public, static and final.

functionality can be restricted when using one of many interfaces.
