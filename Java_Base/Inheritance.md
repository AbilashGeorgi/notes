# Inheritance

Process where one class acquires the fields and methods of another through extension.

with inheritance, we can write common properties and functionality in one class and have other class with unique features extend this single class.

subclass extends superclass / Child and Parent.

* minimize the amount of duplicate code.
* changing behaviour be overriding and modifying without modifying other behaviours.


### Different from pure abstraction

because both are concrete classes.

### Disadvantage

* superclass and subclass can be tightly coupled.
* more levels of implementation to jump through inorder to find the appropriate functionality.
