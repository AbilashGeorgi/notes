# Abstraction

Abstraction hides implementation complexity to achieve generalization.

can be api, design, system

should be able to provide user with example input, output and a broad description of what it does without going into underlying technical details.

eg: driving a car and pressing accelerator

### java - abstract classes

It is a template for a class where some of the functionality is not implemented yet.

Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly.

Concrete classes can extend an abstract class and implement appropriat functionality.

eg: for data management from various tables.
