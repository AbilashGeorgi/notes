# Encapsulation

Binding an object's state and behaviors together.

wrapping data and code acting on data into a single unit

java - Class

we want to keep related data and behaviour together.

we can hide a class's data from other classes using encapsulation.

data would be accessible throug specific methods - data hiding

all fields made private and write public getters and setters

Abstraction provides generalization while Encapsulation hides unwanted implementation details from the users.

* improves reusability
* makes code more maintainable
* makes unit testing easier
